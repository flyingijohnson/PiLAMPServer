# PiLAMPServer
This project was for school. I can't find the details of me putting together.
The RaspberryPi website has a very good details of putting it together. More will be added as I go back and set it up.

The only problems I ran into while putting this together was actually accessing the server
from a different device. I could reach it, but it didn't come across the network 
with all of the media.

Putting a LAMP web server on a Raspberry Pi 4
LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and design using Wordpress

This project is readily available at: 
https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lamp-web-server-with-wordpress

Hardware I used:
  - Raspberry Pi 4 with power source (I used the 4GB module, but this will work on lesser versions)
  - Monitor to access terminal
  - Keyboard & mouse
  - Ethernet cable for wired internet connection (Optional as the pi 4 has wifi capabilities)
  - MicroSD card (I used a 32GB MicroSD)
